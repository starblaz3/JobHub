# JobHub

## About
- Developed a MERN stack based SaaS application for job-hunting and recruiting employees as part of an assignment within 2 weeks.
- MongoDb database schema is 3NF normalized for most efficient storage and access.
- Backend minimizes local caching the data by transfering load via database access queries.

## Installation and execution
- Install dependencies in package.json file in respective folder.
- Run "npm start" command in CLI in both frontend and backend folder to use the application.
- Use the link generated in frontend CLI to navigate and use the website locally.

## Note
- Assumed that port 27017 port is open on your network as my application uses mongo atlas as cloud database for this project.
- ps: port 27017 isn't open on IIITH network , neither are the gaming ports for "security concerns" :<.
